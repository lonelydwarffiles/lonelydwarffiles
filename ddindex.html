    <h2>"People often shit themselves when they die.</h2>
    <h3>Their muscles slack and their souls flutter free and everything else just... slips out."</h3>

    <h2>"Arterial spray hissing through his fingers.</h2>
    <h3>Realization dawning in his eyes—<i>shes's killed me, O, God, she's killed me</i>—turning around in a fury, and he whirled on the girl, hands outstretched, fingers curled into claws."</h3>

    <h1>Review:</h1><p>My thoughts on <i>Nevernight</i>; it's damn amazing, beautifully written. Crafted by an elegant hand sweeping over the paper with a pen. The thoughts and desires of the author's imagination shaping the ink into words that convey a style of writing I've never seen before. It's a book that I'll come back to many times, will read any and all in its series, and recommend to everyone. So... All in all, it was a fantastical experience to read.</p>
